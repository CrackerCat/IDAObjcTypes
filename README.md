# IDAObjcTypes
A collection of (public and private) types and functions definitions useful for Objective-C binaries analysis.

## Why even?
Would you rather re-define the same functions or types over and over as you work in different binaries?

## Usage
From IDA, simply go to `File > Load file > Parse C header file` then choose `IDA.h` to import everything at once.

## Included Frameworks/Libraries
More to be added as the owner reverses more binaries.
